# vr-lit-search
A cursory analysis of XR-related publications in AGU journals and Fall Meeting conference proceedings. 


## Fall Meeting Publications:
These were pulled from NASA's [Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/). 
You can see an interactive visualization of the abstracts [here](https://kcollins.github.io/vr-lit-search/plots/XR%20Abstracts%20at%20AGU%20Fall%20Meeting%20Histogram_Labeled.html), and the code used to run and visualize the query [here](https://github.com/KCollins/vr-lit-search/blob/main/VR%20Lit%20Search.ipynb). 

## AGU Journal Publications
These were obtained from Scopus: `( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "virtual reality" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "augmented reality" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "virtual environment" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "spatial computing" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "extended reality" ) AND DOI ( 10.1029/* ) )`. (AGU publication DOIs begin with the stem 10.1029.)

You can see an interactive visualization of the articles [here](https://kcollins.github.io/vr-lit-search/plots/XR%20Articles%20in%20AGU%20Journals%20Histogram_Labeled.html), and the code used to visualize it [here](https://github.com/KCollins/vr-lit-search/blob/main/VR%20Lit%20Search%20Journals.ipynb). 
This query only identified 25 articles since 1999, however, which indicates that most XR conversations in Earth and space science are taking place primarily at conferences, rather than in journals.
