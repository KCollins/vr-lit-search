	abstract = {Flood risk management institutions and practitioners need reliable and easy-to-use approaches that incorporate the changing climate conditions into flood predictions in ungauged basins. The present work aims at developing an operative procedure to include the expected variation in precipitation extremes in flood frequency analysis. We relate Flood Frequency Curves (FFC) and Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves through quantile-quantile relationships, whose slopes represent the elasticity of floods to precipitation extremes. Assuming that the percentage variations of precipitation and flood quantiles are linked by the quantile-quantile relationship, we obtain modified FFC accounting for the projected changes in precipitation extremes. The methodology is validated in a virtual world inspired by the Rational Formula approach, where flood events are the result of the combination of two jointly distributed random variables: extreme precipitation and peak runoff coefficient. The proposed methodology is found to be reliable for large return periods in basins where flood changes are dominated by precipitation changes rather than variations in the runoff generation process. To illustrate its practical usefulness, the procedure is applied to 227 catchments within the Po River basin in Italy using projected percentage changes of precipitation extremes from CMIP5 CORDEX simulations for the end of the century (2071–2100) and RCP 8.5 scenario. With projected changes in 100-year precipitation ranging from 5% to 50%, the corresponding variations in 100-year flood magnitudes are expected to span a broader range (10%–90%). A substantial heterogeneity in catchment responses to rainfall changes exists due to different elasticities of floods to precipitation extremes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ship-tracks are important natural/opportunistic experiments to study aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs). However, detectable ship-tracks are not produced in many instances. Virtual ship-tracks have been conceived to expand the scale of ACIs analyses. Cloud responses in virtual ship-tracks differ strongly from those of detected ones. Here we show that the current approach of virtual ship-tracks can lead to systematic biases and errors and suggest necessary improvements. Errors in trajectory modeling introduce mismatches between areas actually affected by ship-emissions and virtual ship-track locations, that is, positional errors. Positional errors systematically underestimate ACI signals and the underestimate is severe as indicated by analysis of cloud droplet number concentration changes. The assumption of fixed ship-track width also systematically diminishes resulting aerosol effects by more than 10%, which leads to a forcing difference of around 0.1 (Formula presented.). We make suggestions to improve the simulation of virtual ship-tracks so that their full potential for studying ACIs can be unleashed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The shapes of mantle plumes are sensitive to mantle viscosity, density structure, and flow patterns. Increasingly, global tomographic models reveal broad plume conduits in the lower mantle and highly tilting conduits in the mid and upper mantle. Previous studies mostly relied on 2D slices to analyze plume shapes, but fully investigating the complexity of 3D plume structures requires more effective visualization methods. Here, we use immersive headset-based virtual reality (VR) to visualize the full-waveform global tomographic models SEMUCB-WM1 and GLAD-M25. We develop criteria for the identification of plume conduits based on the relationship between the plume excess temperature and the V<inf>S</inf> anomaly (δV<inf>S</inf>). We trace 20 major plume conduits, measure the offsets of the conduits in azimuth and distance with respect to the hotspots, calculate the tilt angle, and evaluate the δV<inf>S</inf> along all traced conduits. We compare our traced conduits with the conduits predicted by global mantle convection models and vertical conduits. The wavespeed variations along conduits traced from each tomographic model are slower than modeled or vertical conduits, regardless of which tomographic model they are evaluated in. The shapes of traced conduits tend to differ greatly from modeled conduits. Plume ponding and the emergence of secondary plumes, which could result from a combination of compositional variations, phase transitions, small-scale convection, and variations in viscosity, can contribute to the complex observed plume shapes. The variation of δV<inf>S</inf> along the traced conduits and complex plume shapes suggest a thermochemical origin of many plumes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In drylands, runoff during storms redistributes water and nutrients from bare soil areas to vegetated patches, subsidizing vegetation with additional resources. The extent of this redistribution depends on the interplay between surface roughness and permeability; greater permeability in vegetated patches promotes run-on to vegetation, but greater surface roughness diverts runoff, producing tortuous flow paths that bypass vegetation. Here, this interplay is examined in virtual experiments using the 2D Saint Venant Equations to measure runoff connectivity. Flowpaths are delineated using tracers advected by the flow. Distances between tracer sources and sinks along flowpaths measure hydrologic connectivity at two lengthscales: connectivity to the hillslope outlet and within-slope source-sink connectivity. Differences between these connectivity lengthscales indicate how flow may “by-pass” vegetated patches within hillslopes. At the hillslope scale, a derived power-law relation between the runoff coefficient and outlet connectivity describes hillslope water losses, providing a foundation for identifying landscapes likely to shed water. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integrated terrestrial system models predict the coupled water, energy and biogeochemical cycles. Simulations with these models are affected by uncertainties of model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, atmospheric forcings and the biophysical processes. Data assimilation (DA) can quantify and reduce the uncertainty. This has been tested intensively for single compartment models, but far less for integrated models with multiple compartments. We constructed a virtual reality (VR) with a coupled land surface-subsurface model under the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform, which mimics the Neckar catchment in southern Germany. Soil moisture and groundwater level (GWL) data extracted from the simulated VR are used as measurements to be assimilated with state-only/state-hydraulic parameter estimation. Soil moisture DA improves soil moisture characterization in the vertical profile and the neighboring grid cells, with a 40 ∼ 60% reduction of root mean square error (RMSE) over the observation points. In spite of a small ensemble size of 64 members, assimilating soil moisture data improved saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation around the measurement locations. The characterization of evapotranspiration and river discharge only show limited improvements (1% at observation points and less than 0.1% in RMSE at 3 selected gauge locations respectively). GWL DA not only improves the GWL characterization (76 ∼ 88% RMSE reduction at observation locations) but also soil moisture for some cases. In addition, a clear improvement in GWL characterization is observed up to 8 km from the observations, and updating the model states of the saturated zone only instead of the complete domain gives better performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Slow recovery of educational services following such events is likely to cause traumatic stress in children, lead families to out-migrate, and affect the community's overall social stability. Methods for quantifying and assessing the restoration process of educational systems and their dependencies on other supporting infrastructure have not received adequate attention. This study introduces, for the first time, a new framework to evaluate the functionality, recovery, and resilience of a school system following severe earthquake events. The framework considers both the quantity and quality of education services provided, school enrollment, and staff employment, as well as the interaction between various agents such as staff, students, parents, administration, and community. A virtual testbed community, Centerville, is utilized to highlight the application of this framework. The impact of school reopening policies on the number of students enrolled as well as the potential for homeschooling is also considered. The availability of various enrollment alternatives for students, backup classroom space and functioning utility systems, and facilitation of staff and supplies transfer between schools substantially increase the resilience of the education service. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When applying environmental models, the choice of model complexity and the design of field campaigns depend on each other and on the modeling/prediction goal. We propose jointly optimizing model complexity and data collection (design) by maximizing the expected performance for the modeling goal. We use ensembles of highly resolved virtual realities and of less complex modeling variants that differ in their degrees of upscaling and simplified parameterization. For each design under consideration, we simulate hypothetical measurement data (subject to noise) with all realizations of all models. To mimic model calibration with hypothetical data, we identify pairs of best fitting realizations between virtual reality and each model variant for each design. Then, we emulate model choice by selecting (across the model variants, for each design and for each virtual reality) the pair that shows the best predictive match in the modeling goal. Finally, we identify the model/design combination that offers, on average over all virtual realities, the best predictive match. As a test application, we consider a heterogeneous, stratified aquifer, in which the stratification enhances hydraulic anisotropy on the macroscale. We define two different modeling goals: (a) estimating the hydraulic conductivity tensor upscaled to the full aquifer thickness and (b) predicting the pumping rate needed to dewater a construction pit. Our results indicate that jointly optimizing observation networks and model selection can reduce the prediction uncertainty of parameters at lower experimental costs. We also show that the involved trade-offs between model complexity and required design depend on the target quantity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Major arc S and ScS multibounce waves were also measured. Virtual station data are referenced to empirical wavelets constructed from direct S waves for each event. The virtual station approach is useful for low SNR data, bolstering wave path coverage in the southern hemisphere. Goodness of fit measurements between the adapted empirical wavelet and virtual station waveforms are documented, as well as SNRs, allowing for objective definition of travel time measurement quality. From a data set of 360 earthquakes and 8,407 seismographic stations, nearly 4 million records were utilized to construct 248,657 virtual station stacked seismograms, which were compared to best-fitting empirical wavelets. After human inspection of virtual station results, 8,871 travel time measurements were retained from 19 different minor and major arc seismic wave types. Higher multibounce data improve sampling of the southern hemisphere. From 188,003 single seismograms, 3,331 multibounce wave measurements were also made. Comparisons of single seismogram and virtual station stack measurements show a consistent bias: Virtual stack onset times are systematically early due to a broadening effect from stacking records with arrival time differences, which we correct for.

	abstract = {Understanding streamflow generation and its dependence on catchment characteristics requires large spatial data sets and is often limited by convoluted effects of multiple variables. Here we address this knowledge gap using data-informed, physics-based hydrologic modeling in two catchments with similar vegetation and climate but different lithology (Shale Hills [SH], shale, 0.08 km<sup>2</sup>, and Garner Run [GR], sandstone, 1.34 km<sup>2</sup>), which influences catchment topography and soil properties. The sandstone catchment, GR, is characterized by lower drainage density, extensive valley fill, and bouldery soils. We tested the hypothesis that the influence of topographic characteristics is more significant than that of soil properties and catchment size. Transferring calibration coefficients from the previously calibrated SH model to GR cannot reproduce monthly discharge until after incorporating measured boulder distribution at GR. Model calibration underscored the importance of soil properties (porosity, van Genuchten parameters, and boulder characteristics) in reproducing daily discharge. Virtual experiments were used to swap topography, soil properties, and catchment size one at a time to disentangle their influence. They showed that clayey SH soils led to high nonlinearity and threshold behavior. With the same soil and topography, changing from SH to GR size consistently increased dynamic water storage (S<inf>d</inf>) from ~0.12 to ~0.17 m. All analyses accentuated the predominant control of soil properties, therefore rejecting the hypothesis. The results illustrate the use of physics-based modeling for illuminating mechanisms and underscore the importance of subsurface characterization as we move toward hydrological prediction in ungauged basins. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integrated surface-subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) are well established numerical tools to investigate water flow and contaminant transport processes over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, their ability to correctly reproduce the response of hydrological systems to natural and anthropogenic forcing depends largely on the accuracy of model parameterization, including the level of detail in the representation of the bedrock. This latter is typically incorporated in some way via the bottom boundary of the model domain. Issues of bedrock topography, variable soil depth, and the resulting hillslope storage distribution representation in ISSHMs are vitally important but to date have received little attention. A standard treatment of the bottom boundary, especially in large catchment and continental scale applications, is to model it as a flat or inclined (e.g., parallel to the surface) impermeable base (sometimes with some simple leakage term). This approach does not allow the model to correctly reproduce bedrock-controlled threshold responses such as the fill and spill process, as observed across many hillslope and catchment scale field studies. It is still unclear whether Richards equation-based numerical models are actually able to generate such responses. Here we use a Richards equation-based model (CATHY) to simulate internal transient subsurface stormflow dynamics observed at the well-characterized Panola experimental hillslope in Georgia (USA). Soil and bedrock properties were calibrated starting from values reported in previous studies at the site. Our simulation results show that the model was able to reproduce threshold mechanisms, which in turn affected both the integrated and distributed hydrologic responses of the Panola hillslope. We then developed a set of virtual experiments with modified boundary conditions and base topography at the soil-bedrock interface to explore the bedrock boundary control on transient groundwater flow patterns. Our results show that accurate representation of the lower boundary is crucial for ISSHM simulations of hillslope-scale storm runoff and for connectivity of transient groundwater. We summarize our findings with the development of a new bedrock topographic wetness index that takes into account the unsaturated infiltration dynamics. The index is able to help represent the spatial variability of water table response over the bedrock surface compared to standard surface topography-based indices. This new index may be useful in larger-scale ISSHM applications where an exact bedrock topography representation is not feasible or possible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Headwater groundwater subsidy, defined here as out-of-catchment groundwater flow contribution from a headwater catchment to its larger parent watershed (i.e., higher-order stream), can influence the water quality and quantity of regional water resources. But the integrated flow and transport modeling approaches currently being implemented to quantify this subsidy are limited by an absence of critical field observations, such as water table dynamics and groundwater age that are required to test such models. Here we couple tracer (and hydrometric) observations from the well-studied 4.5-ha M8 headwater catchment in the Maimai experimental watershed with a new semianalytical free-surface integrated flow and transport model. Our main research goals are to quantify the magnitude, age, and flow paths of the headwaters groundwater subsidies at the Maimai experimental watershed. Additionally, we explore through virtual experiments the effects of watershed slope, watershed active thickness, and recharge rate on the age, flow path, and magnitude of out-of-catchment headwater groundwater subsidies versus within-catchment (or local) groundwater flow contributions. Our results show that more than 50% of groundwater recharged in the Maimai headwaters subsidizes their parent watershed. The relative proportion of headwaters groundwater subsidies is inversely proportional to recharge rate and/or directly proportional to slope angle. Our results also show that the age of the headwater groundwater subsidies is more than 500 years, almost 9 times older than the age of within-catchment groundwater flow contributions. These findings highlight the need to consider headwaters groundwater subsidies in groundwater management area considerations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Estimates of effective parameters for unsaturated flow models are typically based on observations taken on length scales smaller than the modeling scale. This complicates parameter estimation for heterogeneous soil structures. In this paper we attempt to account for soil structure not present in the flow model by using so-called external error models, which correct for bias in the likelihood function of a parameter estimation algorithm. The performance of external error models are investigated using data from three virtual reality experiments and one real world experiment. All experiments are multistep outflow and inflow experiments in columns packed with two sand types with different structures. First, effective parameters for equivalent homogeneous models for the different columns were estimated using soil moisture measurements taken at a few locations. This resulted in parameters that had a low predictive power for the averaged states of the soil moisture if the measurements did not adequately capture a representative elementary volume of the heterogeneous soil column. Second, parameter estimation was performed using error models that attempted to correct for bias introduced by soil structure not taken into account in the first estimation. Three different error models that required different amounts of prior knowledge about the heterogeneous structure were considered. The results showed that the introduction of an error model can help to obtain effective parameters with more predictive power with respect to the average soil water content in the system. This was especially true when the dynamic behavior of the flow process was analyzed. © 2012 American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An ecohydrological model Tethys-Chloris (T&C) described in the companion paper is applied to two semiarid systems characterized by different climate and vegetation cover conditions. The Lucky Hills watershed in Arizona represents a typical small, "unit-source" catchment of a desert shrub system of the U.S. southwest. Two nested basins of the Reynolds Creek Experimental watershed (Idaho, U.S.A.), the Reynolds Creek Mountain East and Tollgate catchments, are representative of a semiarid cold climate with seasonal snow cover. Both exhibit a highly non-uniform vegetation cover. A range of ecohydrological metrics of the long-term model performance is presented to highlight the model capabilities in reproducing hydrological and vegetation dynamics both at the plot and the watershed scales. A diverse set of observations is used to confirm the simulated dynamics. Highly satisfactory results are obtained without significant (or any) calibration efforts despite the large phase-space dimensionality of the model, the uncertainty of imposed boundary conditions, and limited data availability. It is argued that a significant investment into the model design based on the description of physical, biophysical, and ecological processes leads to such a consistent simulation skill. The simulated patterns mimic the outcome of hydrological and vegetation dynamics with high realism, as confirmed from spatially distributed remote sensing data. Further community efforts are warranted to address the issue of thorough quantitative assessment. The current lack of appropriate data hampers the development and testing of process-based ecohydrological models. It is further argued that the mechanistic nature of the T&C model can be valuable for designing virtual experiments and developing questions of scientific inquiry at a range of spatiotemporal scales.

	abstract = {Most food production depends, directly or indirectly, on freshwater resources. In the absence of importation of food commodities, population growth is constrained by the availability of local resourcesincluding wateras well as by cultural and health-related factors. The global trade of massive amounts of food makes societies less reliant on locally available water resources, thereby allowing some populations to exceed the limits posed by their local water budget. Thus, international trade implies a virtual transfer of water resources from areas of food production to importing regions. While it is recognized that in the short term this globalization of (virtual) water resources may prevent malnourishment, famine, and conflicts, its long-term effects on the coupled human-natural system remain poorly investigated. Here we develop a minimalist modeling framework to investigate the effect of the uncontrolled trade of food products on the resilience of human societies with respect to drought and famine. Our results suggest that in the long run the globalization of water resources reduces the societal resilience with respect to water limitations in that it leaves fewer options available to cope with exceptional droughts and crop failure. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Because the human perception is well equipped to capture and to make sense of these time-dependent three-dimensional features, a combination of automated constraints and human inspection in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment is used to select clouds that are exemplary in their behavior throughout their entire life span. Three specific cases (ARM, BOMEX, and BOMEX without large-scale forcings) are analyzed in this way," and the considerable number of selected clouds warrants reliable statistics of cloud properties conditioned "on the phase in their life cycle. The most dominant feature in this statistical life cycle analysis is the pulsating growth that is present throughout the entire lifetime of the cloud, independent of the case and of the large-scale forcings. The pulses are a self-sustained phenomenon, driven by a balance between buoyancy and horizontal convergence of dry air. The convective inhibition just above the cloud base plays a crucial role as a barrier for the cloud to overcome in its infancy stage, and as a buffer region later on, ensuring a steady supply of buoyancy into the cloud.

	abstract = {An integrated profiling technique (IPT) for the simultaneous retrieval of the atmospheric state parameters temperature, humidity, and liquid water content profiles is assessed. The method combines measurements of a modern, ground-based profiling station equipped with a microwave profiler, cloud radar, and ceilometer, with the closest operational radiosonde measurement and standard surface-based meteorological measurements. All are combined within an optimal estimation procedure. The accuracy assessment is carried out in a virtual environment of a regional climate model. The model thermodynamic state is converted into the measurement space via so-called forward modeling. The IPT is then applied to the simulated measurements to retrieve the desired atmospheric state parameters which can be evaluated with the original model state. It is found that IPT-derived temperature and humidity profiles can add significant information for the time period between two operational radiosonde ascents, both if the measurements take place at the radiosonde site or if they are spatially apart. The benefits of a profiling station that applies an IPT can be valuable both for the reprocessing of dedicated field campaign data to obtain the best representation of the atmospheric state and for nowcasting and data assimilation applications. Depending on the density of the given operational radiosonde network, a ground-based profiling station has the potential of either significantly improving the quality of such a network or even substituting a small number of radiosonde stations. A further benefit of a ground-based profiling station is the retrieval of cloud microphysical properties, where IPT liquid water path retrieval accuracies show values better than 10 g m<sup>-2</sup>, and liquid water content profiles can be derived with relative accuracies of ∼30%.

	abstract = {The use of seismic imaging techniques is widespread. Numerous three-dimensional (3-D) tomographic models have been presented over the last 30 years and subsequently analyzed by a wider community of seismologists, geodynamicists, mineral physicists, and geochemists. However, platform-independent, open source, user-friendly software for interactive exploration of tomographic models does not exist. Here, we present a package for interactive visualization, analysis, and presentation of tomographic models. Using a set of four Matlab programs, multiscale tomographic models can be explored in Cartesian or spherical coordinate systems; data subsets can be extracted and combined; publication-quality figures can be produced; and Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) models can be produced for 3-D visualization and publication on the World Wide Web. This type of freely available software package will encourage the distribution of tomographic models in a standardized form for independent peer review by the research community.

	abstract = {An experiment illustrating two rovers cooperatively exploring a field site was performed at Black Rock Summit, Nevada, in May 2000. The rovers FIDO and K9 are mechanically identical prototype planetary rovers designed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. FIDO carried high-resolution false-color infrared and low-resolution monochrome stereo cameras and an infrared point spectrometer on a mast-mounted pointable platform, a manipulator arm equipped with a color microscopic imager, and a coring drill for sample collection. K9 carried on a mast-mounted pointable platform high-resolution color and low-resolution monochrome stereo cameras, and a Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrometer for standoff elemental analysis. A team located at Jet Propulsion Laboratory commanded the two rovers for 3 days. K9 obtained stereo images of targets, and three-dimensional models were constructed to determine the best locations for FIDO to obtain core samples. A drilling target was selected 1.5 m from the starting position of FIDO. Six command cycles and 2 m of traversing were required for FIDO to reach, drill into, and place an instrument on the target. K9 required 11 command cycles to traverse 60 m and obtain full-coverage stereo images of two rock targets along its route. Virtual reality-based visualization software called Viz provided situational awareness of the environment for both rovers. Commands to K9 were planned using Viz, resulting in improved rover performance. The results show that two rovers can be used synergistically to achieve science goals, but further testing is needed to completely explore the value of two-rover missions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work analyzes the behavior and effectiveness of a science team using the Marsokhod mobile robot to explore the Silver Lake region in the Mojave Desert near Baker, California. The work addresses the manner in which the geologists organized themselves, how they allocated their time in different activities, how they formed and communicated scientific hypotheses, and the frequency with which they requested different types of data from the mission archive during the first 3 days of the mission. Eleven scientists from the NASA Ames Research Center and three of the five scientists who participated from their home institutions were videotaped as they worked throughout the 3-day experiment. The videotape record indicates that 46% of available person-hours were consumed in semistructured or formal meetings and that only 1% of their time was spent studying immersive, three-dimensional virtual reality models of the robot's surroundings. The remainder of their time was spent in unstructured work sessions in groups of two or three. Hypothesis formation and evolution patterns show a meager flow of information from the distributed science team to the on-site team and a bias against reporting speculative hypotheses. Analysis of the visual imagery received from the robot indicates that acquisition of the large panoramic information leads to high levels of redundancy in the data acquired. The scientists' archive requests indicate that small, specifically requested image targets were the most frequently accessed information. The work suggests alternative organizational structures that would expedite the flow of information within the geologic team. It also advocates emphasizing specific science targets over high-resolution, stereoscopic, panoramic imaging when programming a mobile robot's onboard cameras.

	abstract = {The Mars Pathfinder mission used a unique capability to rapidly generate and interactively display three-dimensional (3-D) photorealistic virtual reality (VR) models of the Martian surface. An interactive terrain visualization system creates and renders digital terrain models produced from stereo images taken by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) camera. The stereo pipeline, an automated machine vision algorithm, correlates features between the left and right images to determine their disparity and computes the corresponding positions using the known camera geometry. These positions are connected to form a polygonal mesh upon which IMP images are overlaid as textures. During the Pathfinder mission, VR models were produced and displayed almost as fast as images were received. The VR models were viewed using MarsMap, an interface that allows the model to be viewed from any perspective driven by a standard three-button computer mouse. MarsMap incorporates graphical representations of the lander and rover and the sequence and spatial locations at which rover data were taken. Graphical models of the rover were placed in the model to indicate the rover position at the end of each day of the mission. Images taken by Sojourner cameras are projected into the model as 2-D "billboards" to show their proper perspective. Distance and angle measurements can be made on features viewed in the model using a mouse-driven 3-D cursor and a point-and-click interface. MarsMap was used to assist with archiving and planning Sojourner activities and to make detailed measurements of surface features such as wind streaks and rock size and orientation that are difficult to perform using 2-D images. Superresolution image processing is a computational method for improving image resolution by a factor of n<sup>1/2</sup> by combining n independent images. This technique was used on Pathfinder to obtain better resolved images of Martian surface features. We show results from superresolving IMP camera images of six targets including near- and far-field objects and discuss how the resolution improvement aids interpretation. Similar flood deposits can be seen on both of the Twin Peaks that cannot be resolved in raw images. Millimeter-sized pits are resolved on the rocks Wedge and Halfdome. Other rocks at the Pathfinder site exhibit fine-scale layering that is otherwise invisible. Use of the method resulted in the probable discovery of an artifact of intelligent life on Mars: a part of the Pathfinder spacecraft.
