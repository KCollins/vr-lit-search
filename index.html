<p>Here are some plots of VR-related work in AGU publications. The goal is to show the trend of interest in the topic over time.  </p>
<p>These plots were created with Plotly express, which has <a href="https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/">many options</a> for different plots. Click the legend entries to turn categories on and off. To view a particular category in isolation, double-click its entry in the legend.</p>
<p>Click <a href="plots/VR Abstracts at AGU Fall Meeting Histogram_Labeled.html">here</a> for a labeled histogram of VR-related abstracts at the AGU Fall Meeting. </p>


<!-- <p>(Plotly express can also do box plots, but I haven't done anything with that yet.)</p> -->
